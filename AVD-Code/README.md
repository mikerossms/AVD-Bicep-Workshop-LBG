# AVD using Bicep Workshop

Welcome to the code base for the AVD deployment using Bicep workshop.

There are two main code-bases:

- TemplateCode - This is the code you will be working on (feel free to edit this locally or copy it to a new folder)
- FullCode - This provides the full and complete code for the deployment

Each code-base has its own README.md - please refer to those for more information
